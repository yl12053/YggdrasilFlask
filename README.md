Hmm... this is T2 speaking.<br>
You may not know who I am, but this doesn't matter.<br>
This is a story that introduce this project and explain why the project getting deprecated.<br>
This project is originally acts as a self-implemented python version as yggdrasil in Python.<br>
Since this project is written by myself, <br>
I would have a better knowledge of my code and I can edit the code to achieve custom function such as the compatibility to a Flarum forum authentication system.<br>
However, some member might know, one of the manager come back,<br>
and shut the project down by defining this into a <span style="color: red">"useless project"</span> and give a very complicated solution (both on code and user) based on a php-based opensource project.<br>
Hence, this project is deprecated forever and only a few people know the existance of this project.
