Hmm... this is T2 speaking.
This project is originally acts as a self-implemented python version as yggdrasil in Python.
Since this project is written by myself, I would have a better knowledge of my code and I can
edit the code to achieve custom function such as the compatibility to a Flarum forum authentication system.
However, some member might know, one of the manager come back, and shut the project down by
defining this into a "useless project" and give a very complicated solution (both on code
and user) based on a php-based opensource project.
Hence, this project is deprecated forever and only a few people know the existance of this
project.
